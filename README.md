# Transparent Referendum Initiative: CSV filter script

In May 2018, Ireland will hold a referendum on whether or not to repeal the 8th amendment of the Constitution, a provision that currently restricts access to abortion.

The Transparent Referendum Initiative (TRI) is a group of volunteers who believe that the referendum process should allow for a open, truthful and respectful debate.

This tool is a simple Python script to ingest multiple CSV files and filter them based upon selected keywords.
